matlabfrag is a function which exports a Matlab figure to .eps and .tex files for use in LaTeX/pdfLaTeX/LyX. It is inspired by LaPrint, but is intended to be more WYSIWYG, by respecting figure handles better.

Some of the advantages of matlabfrag compared to LaPrint are: 
- Much more emphasis on WYSIWYG. 
- Handles figures that need the OpenGL or Z-Buffer renderers. 
- Text objects are sized correctly (such as with a legend). 
- Tick labels are handled better. 
- Reduced number of options (which could also be viewed as a disadvantage). 

To include the figures in LaTeX, pdfLaTeX and LyX I recommend the pstool package. More information can be found in the User Guide.
